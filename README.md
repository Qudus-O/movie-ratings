# Fandango Movie Ratings
## Is Fandango Still Inflating Ratings?
Fandango's website features a 5-star rating system, with 0 stars as the minimum and 5 stars as the highest rating. In October 2015, Walt Hickey, a data journalist, analyzed movie ratings data and discovered significant evidence that Fandango's rating system was biased and dishonest. He reported his findings in this article, which is an excellent example of data journalism and well worth reading.

Fandango officials responded that the biased rounding off was caused by a bug in their system rather than an intentional action, and they vowed to remedy the bug as quickly as possible. Presumably, this has already occurred, but we can't be certain because the actual rating value no longer appears in the pages' HTML.

This research will analyze movie ratings data to see if Fandango's rating system has changed since Hickey's analysis.
